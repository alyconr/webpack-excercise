### Webpack Exercise
This project contains an exercise to help you understand and learn how to use Webpack, a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications.

Webpack is a powerful tool that allows you to bundle and optimize your JavaScript code, as well as manage and load various other assets such as CSS, images, and fonts. It provides a modular approach to building applications by allowing you to organize your code into separate modules and efficiently bundle them for deployment.

In this exercise, you will find a simple project structure with a few JavaScript files, CSS files, and an HTML file. Your task is to configure and use Webpack to bundle all these files into a single bundle file that can be easily loaded by a web browser.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
4. Explore the project structure and familiarize yourself with the existing files.
5. Configure Webpack by creating a webpack configuration file (e.g., webpack.config.js) and define the necessary loaders and plugins.
6. Use Webpack to bundle the project files into a single output bundle.
7. Test the bundled application by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
8. Make any necessary modifications to the webpack configuration or project files to ensure everything is properly bundled and functioning as expected.
9. Feel free to experiment and explore different Webpack features, such as code splitting, optimizations, and integrating with other tools or frameworks. This exercise aims to provide you with a hands-on experience to become familiar with Webpack and its capabilities.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the official Webpack documentation (https://webpack.js.org/) or seek help from the vibrant community of Webpack users.

Happy bundling!
